Folder divide:
	Divide.asm - Divide two numbers in logorithmic time
Folder sort:
	Sort.asm - Sort an array in descending order
Folder fill:
	Fill.asm - Blackening the screen by a key press
Folder mult:
	Mult.asm - multiplie 2 numbers.

Remarks
-------
Divide.asm - 
Receive 2 inputes into RAM[13], RAM[14] and put the divide resault into RAM[15]. The divide operation 
took a logaritmic time.

Sort.asm - 
The program will sort an array from an adress that we recieve from RAM[14], in length that inputs 
into RAM[15]. The sorting is done in descending order.

Fill.asm - 
This program illustrates low-level handling of the screen and keyboard devices. In particulate, 
the program runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input. When a key is pressed 
(any key), the program blackens the screen, i.e. writes "black" in every pixel. When no key is 
pressed, the program clears the screen, i.e. writes "white" in every pixel.

Mult.asm - 
In the Hack framework, the top 16 RAM words (RAM[0] ... RAM[15]) are also referred to as the 
so-called virtual registers R0 ... R15. With this terminology in mind, this program computes the 
value R0*R1 and stores the result in R2.
